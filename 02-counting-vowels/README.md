# Counting vowels

This function counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are in a given string.

## How it works

1. It makes all letters in the input lowercase.
2. It checks each letter:
   - If the letter is a vowel, it adds 1 to the count.
3. It returns the total number of vowels found.

## Example

Input:
```js
countVowels("Hello World");
```

Output:
```
3
```
Explanation: The vowels are "e", "o", and "o".
